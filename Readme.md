![3-Tier Application Deployment Diagram](./image.png)

This project provides a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API using AWS Lambda with Node.js and DynamoDB as the database. The API can be connected to an API Gateway for interacting with the API via HTTP methods.

## Features

- **Create**: Add a new item to the DynamoDB table.
- **Read**: Retrieve an item by its ID.
- **Update**: Modify the details of an existing item.
- **Delete**: Remove an item by its ID.
- **DynamoDB**: The project uses Amazon DynamoDB for storing items with a simple schema.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js** (AWS Lambda)
- **AWS DynamoDB** (NoSQL Database)
- **API Gateway** (for exposing Lambda functions over HTTP)
- **AWS IAM** (for permissions)

## Prerequisites

- AWS account with necessary permissions to use Lambda and DynamoDB.
- Node.js installed (for local testing or running scripts).
